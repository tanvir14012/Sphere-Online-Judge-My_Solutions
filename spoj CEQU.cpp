/**
The simplest linear Diophantine equation takes the form ax + by = c,
where a, b and c are given integers.
This Diophantine equation has a solution (where x and y are integers)
if and only if c is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of a and b.
Moreover, if (x, y) is a solution, then the other solutions have the form
 (x + kv, y âˆ’ ku), where k is an arbitrary integer, and u and v are the
 quotients of a and b (respectively) by the greatest common divisor of a
 and b.
